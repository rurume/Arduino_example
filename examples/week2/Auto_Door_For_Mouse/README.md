Arduino_Auto_Door_For_Mouse

This is an Arduino Project about an automatic door in a maze just for a cute mouse,YiJu.
And the project use one Servo Motor(SG-90) and two PING sensor(HC-SR04).

First PING sensor will detect the mouse enter the maze.
When the mouse gets closer between 7 cm distance. The first PING sensor will trigger door opened.

On the other hand, 
When the mouse want to leave the maze and it gets closer between 7 cm, the Second PING sensor will be triggered so that the auto door will be opened again.
